## Goal

This project is a template for building react-app with all my favorite tools already configured.

Obviously, the app is using the latest version of `react`. For avoiding the relative path, I modified the webpack and allowing the import with an alias. I also added the support for sass files.

In addition, I added `prettier` and configured it for working well with `esLint`. Finally, I added the basic usefull package such as the router and the helmet.

The maintainability of the project is checked by `codeclimate`.

## Plan of the presentation

I explain with all the details how I build the project and my way of working.
